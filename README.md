# Architecture-development
Project Overview:
The Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Project aimed to build a strong system for watching and studying disease outbreaks, especially focusing on syndromic surveillance. Using advanced technologies and methods, the project wanted to create a setup that could gather, handle, and study health data from different places. By making the analysis better and ensuring that healthcare systems could work together, the project wanted to help health officials quickly find and deal with health problems.

Objective:
The project wanted to set up a strong system for watching and studying how diseases change over time, especially focusing on syndromic surveillance. By making a system that could gather, handle, and study health data from different places, the goal was to help find and deal with health problems quickly.

Technologies Used:
- MTU College of Computing Cluster: Provided the place to put virtual machines and web-based tools.
- Virtual Machines (VMs): Used technology from VMware to hold different parts of the surveillance system.
- Docker: Helped make things smaller and easier to move around, making it easier to set up and grow the system.
- HAPI FHIR Server: This made it easier for different parts of the healthcare system to talk to each other and share data.
- Synthea:  Open-source synthetic patient data generator for testing purposes.
- OpenEMR: This system helped keep track of patient records and share them with others in the system.
- Postman: Helped check if the different parts of the system were working right and talking to each other correctly.
- MTU-VPN: Made sure that people could connect to the system from far away in a safe way.

Challenges Faced:
- Integration Complexity: Making sure that all the different parts of the healthcare system could talk to each other without any problems.
- Security Concerns: Making sure that only the right people could see and use the health data, so it stayed safe and private.
- Resource Optimization:* Making sure that the system could handle a lot of data and work fast, even when a lot of people were using it.
- Technical Expertise: Learning how to use new tools and ways of doing things, especially in healthcare and data studies.

Outcomes Achieved:
- Established Scalable Infrastructure: Successfully set up a system that could handle a lot of work and could grow as needed.
- Implemented Syndromic Surveillance: Made it possible to watch for signs of health problems early on and keep track of how they changed over time.
- Ensured Interoperability: Made it easier for different parts of the healthcare system to share data and work together.
- Enhanced Analytical Capabilities: Made tools to study the health data and find useful information to help health officials make good decisions and deal with health problems quickly.
